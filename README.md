# 📖 Portfolio: Accessibility <a name="about-project"></a>

In this project, we have improved the accessibility using international standards. Our goal here is to master all of the tools and best practices we have learned about in previous steps. We will be using them in all Microverse projects and most likely in our future jobs as well, so it is important to know them!

## ❓ FAQ <a name="faq"></a>

- **What is a Linter?**

  - Linter is a tool that analyzes source code to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs.

- **What is meant by Gitflow?**

  - Gitflow is an alternative Git branching model that involves the use of feature branches and multiple primary branches.

- **How to use flexbox?**

  - The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the ability to alter its items’ width/height (and order) to  best fill the available space (mostly to accommodate to all kind of display devices and screen sizes). A flex container expands items to fill available free space or shrinks them to prevent overflow.

- **What is grid layout?**

  - CSS Grid Layout excels at dividing a page into major regions or defining the relationship in terms of size, position, and layer, between parts of a control built from HTML primitives.

- **What is hover effect?**

  - Creating CSS link hover effects can add a bit of flair to an otherwise bland webpage. If you’ve ever found yourself stumped trying to make a slick hover effect, then I have six CSS effects for you to take and use for your next project.

- **What is form validation?**

  - When you enter data, the browser and/or the web server will check to see that the data is in the correct format and within the constraints set by the application. Validation done in the browser is called client-side validation, while validation done on the server is called server-side validation. In this chapter we are focusing on client-side validation.

- **What is UX?**

  - User experience (UX) design is the process design teams use to create products that provide meaningful and relevant experiences to users. 

- **What is media query?**

  - Media queries allow you to apply CSS styles depending on a device's general type (such as print vs. screen) or other characteristics such as screen resolution or browser viewport width. 

- **What is accessibility?**

  - Accessibility is essential for developers and organizations that want to create high quality websites and web tools, and not exclude people from using their products and services.
